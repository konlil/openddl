=======

OpenDDL Parser written in C++. Current status is pre-alpha. 

All low level (integer/float/double/string) token parsing functions have been written and a number of tests for each.
Internal functions have been moved to the detail namespace but need a comprehensive set of tests written.

Some clean up/reorganisation is needed to make certain functions much easier to understand.

Phase 2 is now commencing; which is implementing higher level structure/array parsing functions.

As yet no user level implementation is ready to go for interested developers.
