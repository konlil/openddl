=======

OpenDDL Parser written in C++. Current status is pre-alpha. 

Both lexer and parser have been written in ragel and are functional.

Tests need to be finalised and written to provide full coverage.

A number of enhancements must be made to the parser to reach production status. 
These include;
* Dynamic Growable stack for parser
* Enhancing error recovery within parser
* Enhancing error logging within parser
