OpenDDL Parser (0.2)
=======
This interim release addresses a number of defects in the lexer and parser components and introduces the semantic checker.

Further improvements will be made at a later date to clean up the lexer and parser internals but not until the user API has been
developed further.

The library is quite useable for those willing to get their hands dirty in digging through library internals but is not recommended for most.
