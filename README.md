=======

OpenDDL Parser written in C++. Current status is pre-alpha. 

This project isn't dead. Just been working on an experimental branch using
ragel to generate the parser function. Some of the written functionality in
this branch will be reused but no concrete plans as to when the ragel branch 
will be released.
