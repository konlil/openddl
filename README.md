OpenDDL Parser (0.3-WIP)
=======

This release begins the start of implementing a higher level API upon the low level primitives.

With this, a more interesting demo is being developed for interested parties which demonstrates
iterating through the tree structure, searching for specific elements within a file and such.
It is also a great effort in utilising some variables on each command object which have not 
been fully utilised/tested until now.
