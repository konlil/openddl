=======

OpenDDL Parser written in C++. Current status is pre-alpha. 

A lexer has been implemented in Ragel but is missing some documentation 
and internal cleanup. Tests have not been written for the lexer yet.
Two classes of test will be need to be written, stress test and 
functionality validation.

With these written, focus can switch to writing the parser by
hand or using a tool such as LEMON.
